title: What is Open Source GIScience?
---

This is a reflection on readings regarding Open Source GIScience for Friday, February 26.

As we practice Open GIScience in this class, what are the implications for learning, the honor code, and evaluation/grades?
What are the meanings of free software, open source, and open science?
How is free as in the free software movement different from free as in a cost of $0.00?
In what way might something be open source but not free?
As we practice Open GIScience in this class, what are the implications for:
Learning
The Honor Code (link for Middlebury community only)
Evaluation & Grades
Is there space for Open GIScience in an undergraduate liberal arts education?
What risks/benefits do you see for use of open source GIS in:
science?
government?
private businesses?

Both Singleton et al. (2016) and Rey (2009) provided interesting prospectives on the use and function of open source in and out of an academic setting. Although Singleton et al. focussed more on the general implications of open source for the world around us, there were some really interesting concepts introduced about the integration of open source into academia as well. While debating the pros and cons of open source, Singleton et al. argued that without reproducibility the potential advancements of open source would be discounted. Singleton et al. laid out a strong framework for best practices in open source GIScience that can be beneficial in better understanding how we might conduct our labs in this course. This paper has helped me understand further the importance of this movement that is still in its early stages. Creating websites that not only explain our reproductions and replications, but also link all of the data in our open access repositories is key to having more transparency, which further validates these studies we replicate.

Rey (2009) discusses the intersection between science and open source as their differences are important to note in the application of open source to science and academia. Some important distinctions are brought up as Rey outlines the differences between free and open source software, defining free software as something users are able to modify and use for any purpose whereas open source software is not modifiable in the same way although there is still full, free access to the source code.
