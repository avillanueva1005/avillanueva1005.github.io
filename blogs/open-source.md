title: What is Open Source GIScience?
---

This is a reflection on readings regarding Open Source GIScience for Friday, February 26.

  Both Singleton et al. 2016 and Rey 2009 provided interesting prospectives on the use and function of open source in and out of an academic setting. Although Singleton et al. focussed more on the general implications of open source for the world around us, there were some really interesting concepts introduced about the integration of open source into academia as well. While debating the pros and cons of open source, Singleton et al. argued that without reproducibility the potential advancements of open source would be discounted.
